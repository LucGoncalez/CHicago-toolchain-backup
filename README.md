# CHicago Toolchain

## Building it

For building it from scratch, you need:

	A Unix-like environment
	GCC and G++
	Make

## Building the CHicago Assembler

For building the CHicago Assembler, you only need GCC.
Go to the chasm folder and type:

        make

Now you should have the executable of the tool inside of the build folder.
